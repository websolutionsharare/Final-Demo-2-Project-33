## Cloud Deployment Strategies

Cloud deployment strategies define how applications and services are hosted in the cloud. The main strategies include:

1. **Public Cloud**: Resources are owned and managed by third-party providers, offering scalability and cost-efficiency.
2. **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, ensuring greater control and security.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, enabling flexibility and optimized resource usage.
4. **Multi-Cloud**: Utilizes multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in and enhance redundancy.

Each strategy has its own benefits and trade-offs, depending on business needs and goals.
